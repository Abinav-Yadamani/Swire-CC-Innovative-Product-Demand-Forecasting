# Swire-CC-Innovative-Product-Demand-Forecasting

### Summary
This project aims to address Swire's sales forecasting challenges, particularly for innovative beverage products. The objective is to develop accurate forecasting models to optimize production and mitigate overage and underage costs.

### Solution
Our team employed various forecasting techniques, including SARIMA, FB Prophet, and exponential smoothing, to predict sales demand. Additionally, we leveraged social media analytics to gauge public perception of new flavors post-launch.

### Contribution
I contributed to data preprocessing, model selection, and validation. Additionally, I led the exploration of social media analytics as a supplementary tool for forecasting.

### Business Value
Our solution provides Swire with actionable insights to optimize production quantities, reducing the risk of overproduction costs and missed revenue opportunities. By integrating social media analytics, Swire gains a deeper understanding of consumer preferences and can adapt strategies accordingly.

### Challenges
Throughout the project, we encountered challenges in data preprocessing, model selection, and interpretation of results. Ensuring data accuracy and dealing with seasonality were particularly challenging aspects of the project.

### Lessons Learned
This project provided valuable insights into the complexities of sales forecasting in the beverage industry. We learned the importance of flexibility in modeling techniques and the need for continuous adaptation to evolving market trends. Additionally, integrating external data sources such as social media analytics enhanced the robustness of our forecasting models.
